  This website is a framework for a future website it provides a contact tab, a home page, and about me page. I may utilize it for a framework for things like a business website or for personal use. It displays my images and text describing me. It also gives people a chance to find and contact me at any time. Also, it could double as a family website that could be used to tell stories or legacies to our future generation with easy access to many stories, names, and pictures of our family. They can get to know how their parents or event their parents' parents lives at the tips of their fingers. Just an idea I thought of awhile ago.
